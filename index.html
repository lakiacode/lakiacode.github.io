<h1>All about me</h1>

<body>
    <p>My name is lakia, and I from Indianapolis Indiana. I am 17 years old and I am currently a Catapult at Nextech. I am a
        upcoming junior and will be going to Shortridge High School. Some fun facts about me would be I love to cook and
        sing. When I was little I always spent the weekends at my grandmas house and each day she would teach me how to cook.
        She had hundreds of cookbooks put up, I only read about six and I am planning on reading more. Another fun fact would
        be singing, ever since i was 7 years old singing has always been my passion. When I was in the fouth grade I entered
        A singning competition to sing the 'SSB' at the NFL, sadly I did not make it but that did not stop me from doing
        what I love. Freshmen year is when I started my first Computer Science class. At first I had no intrest in the subject
        but when two weeks went by I always had intrest ever since.

        So I started to code and learn the basics of coding and coding lanuages such as html, css, javascript and more. One thing
        that I struggled with at first is making sure that the code does not break and everything is in the right place.
        During my sophmore year I had another Computer Science class, and I enjoyed it. Actually I met someone who was apart of the Catapult program last summer. We became good friends and had good laughs during that year. It was a group of three myself, her and another girl. Throughout the year we created so much. For example we created a live Triva app that surprised a lot of people from different companies. A liitle bit about we created is a app for all ages who would like to have fun during free time. The app has  three catagories to pick from, Movies, Sports and Food. The app has sound and points for when you get the answer right.
